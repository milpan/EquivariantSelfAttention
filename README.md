# EquivariantSelfAttention
An implementation of Equivariant e2 convolutional kernals into a convolutional self attention network, applied to radio astronomy data.


This work extends and builds on previous work:
 - [FR Classification using e2cnn](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08252.pdf), whose code is [here](https://github.com/as595/E2CNNRadGal).
 - [Attention for FR Classificaion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01248), whose code is [here](https://github.com/mb010/AstroAttention).
This work makes extensive use of the `e2cnn` package: [e2cnn](https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/e2cnn).
